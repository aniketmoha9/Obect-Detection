# Obect-Detection
In this problem we try to detect Car and persons present in the images or datasets.
We have used Yolov5 as our detection algorithm.
#Dataset
The annotations were present in the COCO format so we converted the COCO format to YOLO format. We used https://github.com/ssaru/convert2Yolo.git repository for conversion.
